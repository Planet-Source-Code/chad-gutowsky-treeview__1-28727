The purpose of the TreeView example is to show developers some of the basics of using and manipulating the TreeView Control. The example shows how to add Nodes to the control using the five different relationship settings of the Nodes Collection Add Method. It will also allow you to remove a selected Node or branch.
The main focus of the example is to show how to save and restore the Nodes into an Access Database. The algorithm used saves the Nodes in viewing order. This allows you to save and restore the TreeView Control with the Nodes in the same order as the user was viewing them when they closed the application. 
The sample also shows dragging and dropping of Nodes. It allows you to drag a Node and drop it on top of a different Node so that the dragged Node is now the child of the Node it was dropped on.

For more information on the TreeView Control please see On-line help and/or the Visual Basic Component Tools Guide.
